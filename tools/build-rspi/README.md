# Cross-compile for the RaspberryPi platform

This directory provides scripts for cross-compiling flaschentaschen-web for RapberryPi, version 3 or greater (`armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`)
* `setup.sh` generates a docker image which consists of all required build tools. This script only needs to be run initially and everytime the build pipeline has been adjusted.
* `entrypoint.sh` is the entrypoint script of the build docker image generated by `setup.sh`. It runs the actual build command on the source files mounted into the container.
* `build.sh` can be used to run a build (after `setup.sh` has been executed at least once). The build assets can be found at the usual location under `$PROJECT_ROOT/targests/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`.
